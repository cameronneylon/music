Scores and Music - Cameron Neylon
=================================

Various pieces of music, some of which are fully scored, some which are less polished, or 
even not complete. All material here is under a cc0 waiver 
(see [license.txt](../license.txt) in this 
repository). 

Formats and pull requests
-------------------------

Each completed score is generally available in MuseScore format (.mcsz) Music XML 
(.xml) and for completed and formatted pieces as a PDF. Part of the reason for
setting this repository up is to see whether people are interested in contributing
corrections or modifications so pull requests are welcome. I'm unsure how useful
diffs will be so a good description would be appreciated with any PR.

Pieces
------

* Choral
** [John 1:19](../John1-19/) - A completed piece reminiscent of PÃ¤rt (with hints of 
Tavener and Gorecki) 
for SATB choir, organ (semi-optional), and brass (3 Trp, 3 Trb, Tuba, entirely optional). 
Quite an easy piece from the choir's perspective. Setting of the Vulgate latin text of
John 1:19.
** [Kyrie/Exaudi](../Kyrie-Exaudi) - Short completed piece for unaccompanied SATB choir 
piece using 
elements of the Kyrie mass text juxtaposed with "Exaudi orationem meam". Some 
challenging chromatic harmonies but quite tonal over all. 
** [O Magnum Mysterium](../Magnum_Mysterium) - Mostly finished piece for choir setting 
this popular text in
its liturgical form. Fairly wide choral range (bottom D for basses, top A for 
Sopranos and some quite challenging harmonies.
** [Gloria in excelsis](../Gloria_in_Excelsis) - In process version of a non-liturgical 
setting of the Gloria
text. Needs cleaning up and tidying. Choir and organ in this version.
** [Requiem aeternam](../Requiem_Aeternam) - In process version of a setting of the 
opening of the Requiem 
text. Needs cleaning up tidying. Choir and organ in this version.
** [Magnificat](../Magnificat) - Half finished setting of the Magnificat for 
unaccompanied choir. 
* Instrumental and Orchestral
